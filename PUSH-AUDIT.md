Thanks for your work on this. I appreciate it. Some final
checks before I push.

## How to use this runbook

The pre-push audit splits into two waves:

**Wave 1 — mechanical.** Lint, the consistency checker, and
the test suite. Everything here is also what CI runs, so a
wave 1 failure would fail the pull request anyway; catching
it now is cheaper. Always run wave 1 first; wave 2 is only
worth spending on if wave 1 passes.

**Wave 2 — judgment.** Design-system conformance, code
quality, and documentation review. These need a reader, not
a grep.

## Wave 1: Mechanical checks

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

runs shellcheck, actionlint, Biome (JavaScript and CSS lint
plus format checking), file hygiene, and
`tools/consistency-check.py` (the mechanical design-system
rules from docs/consistency-audit.md). Then run the test
suite (setup instructions are in docs/testing.md):

```
pytest tests/
```

If either fails, fix the cause and re-run before spending on
wave 2.

## Wave 2: Judgment checks

### Design-system conformance

Review the diff against the parts of the contract no checker
can prove:

- A new or changed component keeps application judgement out:
  data in through properties, events out, and the *meaning* of
  the data stays the host page's problem
  (docs/components.md).
- New colors are semantic token choices, not "looks right
  next to the thing beside it" (docs/design-tokens.md).
- A new primitive or component is rendered in `demo.html`, and
  has been looked at in **both** palettes: serve the
  repository root (`python3 -m http.server`) and flip the
  theme toggle. The consistency checker proves presence, not
  appearance.
- Anything added to the distributable set is in
  `tools/vendor.sh`'s file list and the Layout list in
  `docs/vendoring.md` (the checker cross-checks these, but
  whether a file *should* be distributable is judgment).

### Code quality

<!-- shared-block: comment-proportion v1 -->
Comment proportion (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/comment-proportion.md`):

- A comment or docstring earns its length by saying what the code
  cannot: the contract, the units, the failure modes, the reason a
  surprising choice is correct. Restating the code in prose is not
  documentation.
- Treat as candidates any added comment or docstring that is longer
  than the code it documents, and any comment block over roughly
  fifteen lines attached to a body under ten. These are candidates,
  not verdicts -- a subtle algorithm, a public API contract, or a
  hard-won bug explanation can justify the length.
- Where the length is not justified the finding is advisory, and
  the fix is to cut the restatement rather than delete the comment:
  keep the why, drop the line-by-line narration of the what.
- Prose that documents user-visible behaviour rather than the
  implementation usually belongs in `docs/`, with the comment
  reduced to a pointer.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

<!-- shared-block: source-file-size v1 -->
Source file size (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/source-file-size.md`):

- Where a repository tracks whole-file human review, a file's cost
  is its length times how often it is touched: every change
  discards the review of the whole file, and the next session
  re-reads all of it. That, rather than taste, is why length is
  worth raising in review at all.
- Treat a source file over roughly 800 lines as a candidate to
  split, and one over roughly 1,500 as wanting a stated reason to
  stay whole. These hold whether or not a repository tracks review
  per file: tracking is what makes the cost repeat and become
  measurable, not what makes a long file expensive to read. Both
  are advisory. Neither is a gate, there is no hard cap, and a
  reviewer who raises one is opening a question, not recording a
  defect.
- Generated files, vendored trees and protocol or data tables are
  exempt: they are not read the way source is, and a tool that
  counts them is measuring the wrong thing.
- Split along a seam that already exists -- one module's public
  entry point, one check, one subcommand, one endpoint -- so that
  a later change touches one of the pieces rather than all of
  them. A file split at a line number rather than at a seam is
  worse than the long file it replaced.
- Length is never reduced by deleting the comments and docstrings
  that explain why the code is the way it is. Those are what make
  a long file reviewable, and trading them for a line count makes
  the review worse while making the number better. Cut duplicated
  scaffolding first; see `comment-proportion` for what earns its
  length.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

!!! note "In this project"

    sfui tracks whole-file human review (`REVIEWS.md`), so the first
    bullet's repeated-review cost applies in full. The vendored
    `lit-core.min.js` and `morphdom-umd.js` are exempt as vendored
    trees. `sf.css` is already past 800 lines: a change that grows it
    is the moment to ask whether a group of primitives should move into
    a file of its own, remembering that any new distributable file must
    also join `tools/vendor.sh` and the Layout list in
    `docs/vendoring.md`.

<!-- shared-block: plan-references-in-code v1 -->
Plan references in code (shared block; do not edit -- the
canonical copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/plan-references-in-code.md`):

- Code, comments, docstrings, test names, fixture descriptions and
  configuration describe the software as it is now. Which plan,
  phase, step or decision produced a line is history, and the plan
  and the commit log already keep it. Do not write "added in phase
  5", "per decision 3", "pending step 5f" or "the phase-4 leaks
  pass": a reader of the code has not read the plan, and the
  number tells them nothing.
- Where a comment cites a plan to explain why the code is the way
  it is, the explanation belongs in the comment. Write the reason
  -- the constraint, the measurement, the failure it prevents --
  and drop the citation. A pointer standing in for the reasoning
  costs every reader a detour, and rots when the plan is archived
  or renumbered.
- A plan link is acceptable only for work that is not built yet: a
  deliberate gap or refusal whose lifting is planned, where
  "deferred; see `PLAN-foo.md`" tells the reader the gap is known.
  The link comes out when the work lands. Prefer an issue link
  where one exists, and write a plan in another repository as an
  absolute URL; the `plan-source-references` audit checks that
  these links resolve.
- Plan documents and commit messages may cite phases and decisions
  freely; recording that history is their job.
- "Phase" in its ordinary sense -- a two-phase commit, a compiler's
  link phase -- is not a plan reference.
- A plan reference a diff adds to code is a finding to fix before
  pushing. References on lines the diff does not touch are backlog,
  not findings against the change.

<!-- shared-block: path-traversal-review v1 -->
Path construction from outside data (shared block; do not edit --
the canonical copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/path-traversal-review.md`):

- Treat as a candidate any filesystem path built from a value the
  process did not choose: a request parameter, an image name, tag or
  digest, a layer path, an archive member name, a filename out of a
  configuration file or a database row.
- The question is not whether the value looks dangerous but whether
  the resulting path is *proved* to stay inside its intended base
  directory. Resolve the joined path with `os.path.realpath()` and
  verify it still starts with the base; a check on the untrusted
  component alone is defeated by symlinks and by encodings the
  check did not anticipate.
- Prefer a helper that cannot be forgotten at a call site --
  `safe_path_join()` in occystrap, or the framework's own
  (`send_from_directory` in Flask) -- over an inline guard repeated
  at each join.
- Archive extraction is the case most often missed: a member name
  inside a tarball or zip is attacker-controlled in exactly the same
  way as a request parameter.
- Where a bare join is correct because every component is
  process-chosen, say so in a comment rather than leaving the
  reader to re-derive it.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

!!! note "In this project"

    `safe_path_join()` and `send_from_directory` are the occystrap and
    Flask helpers; sfui has no server and no archive format, so read
    them as the shape to look for rather than the API to call. Today
    sfui builds almost no paths from outside data: `tools/vendor.sh`
    joins its fixed file list onto the target directory the operator
    names, and the test suite serves the repository root with the
    standard library's `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` to requests the tests
    themselves make. A change that joins a value sfui did not choose
    onto a path is the candidate.

<!-- shared-block: python-version-discipline v1 -->
Python version and typing (shared block; do not edit -- the
canonical copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/python-version-discipline.md`):

- No syntax or standard library API newer than the floor in
  `requires-python`. Structural pattern matching, `X | Y` unions in
  annotations evaluated at runtime, `tomllib`, and
  `datetime.UTC` each raise on an interpreter the package still
  claims to support, and none of them fail in CI when CI runs only
  the newest version. This is the finding to look for first: it is
  a real break on a real user's machine, not a style point.
- New and modified code carries type hints, and mypy is expected to
  be clean over it. A project part way through a staged rollout is
  held to the new code, not to the whole tree.
- Prefer the walrus operator and f-strings where they make the code
  read better, subject to the floor above.
- Raising the floor in `requires-python` is a supported-platforms
  decision, not a convenience: it drops users. If it is genuinely
  right, the platforms table, `requires-python` and
  `constraints.python` in `renovate.json` all move together.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

!!! note "In this project"

    sfui ships no Python package: there is no `pyproject.toml`, so there
    is no `requires-python` floor and no `constraints.python` in
    `renovate.json`. Python here is the test suite (pytest and
    Playwright) and `tools/consistency-check.py`, which run on the
    developer's and CI's own interpreter, so the clauses about the
    declared floor and the platforms table do not apply. The typing and
    readability bullets still do.

<!-- shared-block: functional-test-coverage v1 -->
Functional test coverage (shared block; do not edit -- the
canonical copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/functional-test-coverage.md`):

- The standard is "do we run the code to do the real thing, and
  does it work as intended". Every subcommand exposed on the command
  line, and every endpoint exposed by an API, should have a test
  that exercises it for real rather than against a mock of itself.
- For a change that adds or alters user-visible behaviour, the
  question to answer is which functional test would have failed
  before it and passes after. If there is none, that is the finding,
  and it is a finding about this change rather than a note for
  later.
- Unit tests are held to no coverage percentage, but a branch that
  is reachable from outside the process and has no test is worth
  naming. Error paths and argument validation are where this bites:
  they are the code most often written once and never run again.
- Mocking the system under test proves nothing. Mock the boundary --
  the network, the clock, the hypervisor -- and let the code being
  tested actually run.
- Where a gap is real but out of scope for the change in hand, say
  so plainly and record it, rather than silently widening the
  change or silently leaving it unsaid.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

!!! note "In this project"

    sfui has no command line subcommands or API endpoints. Its
    user-visible surface is the components, the `sf.css` primitives,
    the theme boot script and `tools/vendor.sh`, so read "subcommand or
    endpoint" as those: a new or changed component wants a Playwright
    test in `tests/test_components.py` that renders it in a real
    browser, and a vendoring change wants one in `tests/test_vendor.py`
    that runs the script.

### Documentation review

Changes to component contracts belong in the component file
headers; changes to the system itself belong in `docs/`. A
user-visible change with no docs diff is a finding.

<!-- shared-block: readme-discipline v1 -->
README discipline (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/readme-discipline.md`):

- New user-visible features are documented in `docs/` (and
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `AGENTS.md` where appropriate), not by
  adding bullets to `README.md`.
- `README.md` is a pitch: what the project is, who it is for,
  minimal installation instructions, a small number of usage
  examples, and curated absolute links into `docs/`. It only
  changes when the pitch, the install story, or the
  documentation links change.
- README growth is itself a finding: if the diff adds README
  content that belongs in `docs/`, flag it as blocking and
  move it.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

<!-- shared-block: llm-doc-discipline v1 -->
AGENTS.md and ARCHITECTURE.md discipline (shared block; do not
edit -- the canonical copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/llm-doc-discipline.md`):

- `AGENTS.md` is a working guide: the conventions, invariants and
  gotchas an agent cannot infer by reading the code, plus curated
  links into `docs/`. It is loaded into every session, so every
  line costs context on every task.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` is a map: the component inventory, how data
  moves between components, and why the shape is the way it is.
  A deep dive on one subsystem belongs in `docs/`, where humans
  benefit from it too.
- One canonical home per fact. If `docs/` covers it, link to it
  instead of restating it -- and the same rule applies between
  `AGENTS.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Neither file is a reference manual, a runbook, or a changelog.
  CLI flags, configuration keys, wire protocols, step-by-step
  procedures and plan history go to `docs/`.
- Growth in either file is itself a finding: if the diff adds
  content that belongs in `docs/`, flag it as blocking and move
  it.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

<!-- shared-block: diagram-discipline v1 -->
Diagram discipline (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/diagram-discipline.md`):

- A diagram of *structure or flow* -- components and the arrows
  between them, an ordered exchange of messages, a state machine
  -- is written as a fenced `mermaid` block, not drawn in ASCII.
  GitHub renders those natively and the mkdocs sites render them
  through `pymdownx.superfences`, so the same source is a picture
  in both places.
- Not every box of characters is a diagram. These stay as plain
  code fences, because mermaid cannot express them and would lose
  what they show: directory and file trees; memory maps, address
  space layouts and register or bit-field diagrams, where column
  alignment carries the meaning; wire-format and on-disk byte
  layouts; captured terminal output; and tables. The test is
  whether the picture is nodes and edges. Something that is a
  table with lines drawn on it is a table.
- Pick the diagram type that matches the claim: `flowchart` for
  components and data flow, `sequenceDiagram` for an ordered
  exchange between parties, `stateDiagram-v2` for a state
  machine, `erDiagram` for data relationships. A sequence drawn
  as a flowchart has thrown away the ordering it existed to show.
- A new ASCII box-and-arrow diagram in the diff is a finding.
  Converting one the diff already touches is in scope; converting
  every other diagram in the file is not, because a sweep is its
  own change and its own review.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

<!-- shared-block: plan-phase-references v1 -->
Plan phase references (shared block; do not edit -- the canonical
copy lives in shakenfist/development at
`templates/shared-blocks/plan-phase-references.md`):

- Documentation outside plans directories describes the current
  state of the software, not the history of how it was built. Do
  not write "implemented in phase 5" or "since phase 3 of the
  two-tier CI plan": a reader wants to know whether a feature
  exists, not which phase of which plan delivered it.
- If a documented behaviour is implemented, describe it plainly.
  If it is planned but not yet implemented, link to the master
  plan in `docs/plans/` instead of citing a phase number.
- Reserve the word "phase" for plan documents. A procedural
  document describing a live multi-stage process (a release
  runbook, say) should call its stages "steps" or "stages", so
  that a phase reference in `docs/` is always a plan smell.
- The consistency audit greps `README.md` and `docs/` (excluding
  plans directories) for "phase <number>". Append
  `<!-- audit-ok: phase-reference -->` to a line only when the
  reference is genuinely not about an implementation plan.
<!-- shared-block-end -->

Remember that `README.md` ships in every vendored copy, so a
README change lands in every consumer's static assets on
their next re-vendor.

The management session reviews all findings, fixes any
issues, and confirms the push.
